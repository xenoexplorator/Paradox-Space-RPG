How to play, in details

\section{Milestones and Perks}

The most important events in a \ParadoxSpaceRPG{} story are character \gameterm{Milestones}.
These are defining moments where a character accomplishes a significant goal, whether personal or Sburb-related.
This progress is represented by the character gaining APs, as well as gaining access to any Perk attached to
the Milestone they've completed.

It is the \GM's responsibility to recognize when characters reach Milestones, but players are nonetheless
encouraged to provide their input when impactful events unfold at the gaming table. Discussion about character
arcs should be open among all participants, as long as out-of-game knowledge does not seep into in-game choices
and actions.
