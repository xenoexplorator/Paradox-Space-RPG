\section{Material}
\begin{itemize}
\item Paper
\item Pens, pencils, or other writing utensils
\item A deck of playing cards
\end{itemize}

When setting up for a game session, shuffle the deck of cards before placing it in the center of the gaming area
(where it can easily be accessed by every participant). The Narrator then takes the top ten cards from the deck
to form the start of the discard pile.
