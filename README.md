# Paradox Space RPG

A pen & paper role-playing game based on Andrew Hussie's [Homestuck](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/).

*Paradox Space RPG* is meant to be a role-playing game first and an adaptation second.
While it should feel connected to the source material, it should also be able to stand on its own.
In plain terms, do not think of *Paradox Space RPG* as about role-playing Homestuck.
Think instead of Homestuck as a proto-campaign of *Paradox Space RPG*, the original spark that inspires that which follows.

As such, creating interesting game mechanics and fun role-playing opportunities takes precedence over
fidelity to the source material. The latter is desired, of course, but is not to be expected in all places.
An immediate example of this philosophy is the Role assigned to each player.
While the comic does not need to explore in detail the meaning of each Class and Aspect to tell its story,
the game must do so in order to present its setting.

The game's setting might conflict with your own interpretation of the source material.
This should not be seen as a reason not to play, but as an inspiration to adapt the game to your own style.
After all, if Homestuck is a *Paradox Space RPG* campaign, then surely Hussie made up house
rules of his own during its course.
